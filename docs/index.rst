About
-----

Pensando-ELK is a tool to search and view data that is generated by one or more Pensando
Distributed Services Cards (DSCs).  It is a combination of several pre-existing Elastic
applications along with the addition of Pensando's filebeat module to allow for flow
monitoring, network threat detection and security event viewing.

Currently it is built using a combination of in-house bash scripts (for install) and
Ansible playbooks for setup and running.
