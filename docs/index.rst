About
-----

Pensando-ELK is a tool to search and view data that is generated by one or more Pensando
Distributed Services Switch (DSS).  It is a set of containers instantiated by docker-compose and Pensando provided
visualizations and dashboards to allow for flow monitoring, network threat detection and security event viewing.

.. note::
   `Check the version in the README file <https://gitlab.com/pensando/tbd/siem/elastic/elk-pensando/-/blob/main/README.md?plain=0>`_ for the branch you are using to verify that the CXOS and PSM sofware releases
   are compatible with the version of pensando-elk you are using.
